# Insurance Claim Prediction
# Car Insurance Claim Prediction

## Project Description

This project aims to help car insurance companies better predict if a prospective customer is likely to file a claim within the next six months. We analyze a dataset of car insurance claim data to develop predictive models and derive valuable insights for both insurers and consumers.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 10,302 rows and 27 features, including:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, marital status, etc.)
- Vehicle information (car type, age, value, etc.)
- Driving history (past claims, license status, etc.)
- Policy details (coverage type, duration, etc.)


## Objective

Our goal is to develop accurate predictive models that can assess the likelihood of a customer filing an insurance claim. This information can help insurance companies:

1. Better assess risk
2. Optimize pricing strategies
3. Improve customer targeting and retention

## Significance

This project addresses a critical business challenge in the car insurance industry. By improving claim prediction accuracy, we can help:

- Insurance companies reduce costs and improve profitability
- Consumers make more informed decisions about their insurance coverage
- Contribute to the overall efficiency of the car insurance market


## Methodology

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Development and Evaluation
    - Logistic Regression
    - Naive Bayes
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

## Key Findings

- Young drivers (<25 years) are more likely to file claims
- Higher education levels correlate with fewer claims
- Past claimants are twice as likely to file again
- Married individuals file significantly fewer claims
- Long-term customers tend to file fewer claims


## Best Performing Model

XGBoost outperformed other models with:

- Accuracy: 0.79
- Recall: 0.46
- F1 Score: 0.54


## Business Recommendations

1. Prioritize policies for individuals with higher education and high-income professions
2. Focus on customers with clean claims histories and no traffic violations
3. Target households with a low likelihood of children driving the insured vehicles
4. Develop loyalty programs to retain long-term customers (>2 years)
5. Offer incentives to experienced professionals (>2 years in current job)
